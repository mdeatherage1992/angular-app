message:
  Document(s) not found for class Area with id(s) 1.
summary:
  When calling Area.find with an id or array of ids, each parameter must match a document in the database or this error will be raised. The search was for the id(s): 1 ... (1 total) and the following ids were not found: 1.
resolution:
  Search for an id that is in the database or set the Mongoid.raise_not_found_error configuration option to false, which will cause a nil to be returned instead of raising this error when searching for a single id, or only the matched documents when searching for multiples.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (AreasController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
